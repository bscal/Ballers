## Ballers
Ballers is a competitive multiplayer basketball simulation game built with Unity v2020.

Ballers aims to be a fun, skill based, and strategic game. Trying to include a more realistic game then other basketball games, while also
keeping an enjoyable and customizable experience.

Ballers uses MLAPI and Steam to handle most of the networking. And SteamP2P for hosting matches.

The game is in VERY early development and I am making it mostly to learn and get better with unity/gamedev/game design. So you will currently receive no support or downloads until further into the project. I will also not a lot of detail or documentation for setting this up yet.

Ballers is 3D but uses voxel models or voxel style for the player model. 

### Dependencies
